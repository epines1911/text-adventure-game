# text-adventure-game

It is an assignment for Oriented-Object-Programming wtih Java in UoB. The focus of this assignment is the construction of a general-purpose socket-server game-engine for text adventure games.

Now I have implemented several functions for this game, like:
- Map system
- Pick up/drop items
- Player's health system
- Interactions with NPC
